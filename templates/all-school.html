    <h3>All school page</h3>
    <p>
        On this page you should show the result of a query that returns the name of the mentors plus the name and country
        of the school (joining with the schools table) ordered by the mentors id column.
        BUT include all the schools, even if there's no mentor yet (in that cell, "No data" should be displayed)!
